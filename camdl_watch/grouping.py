"""Parameter grouping — pure, dependency-free.

Hierarchical fits expand an indexed model parameter (``k_raw[patch]``) into one
estimated coordinate per stratum (``k_raw_Bo``, ``k_raw_Kenema``, …). That can be
14+ leaves, which turns the pair plot into a 22x22 monster and clutters the trace
grid and diagnostics table.

This module detects those indexed *families* so the UI can collapse them by
default and let the user toggle whole families or individual leaves on/off.

A **family** is a base name ``B`` such that two or more estimated coordinates
match ``B_<stratum>``. The base is the longest such prefix, so ``k_raw_Bo`` and
``k_raw_Western_Area_Urban`` both group under ``k_raw`` (not ``k`` or ``k_raw_Western``).
A coordinate that is the *only* member of its base (e.g. ``mu_k`` -> base ``mu``)
is a **scalar**, not a family.

The default selection shows scalars and hyperparameters (everything that is not
an indexed leaf) and hides the leaves.
