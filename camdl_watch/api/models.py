"""Pydantic wire models — the typed JSON contract the browser depends on.

These re-project the Python core's ADTs (``state.py`` / ``docs.py`` /

schema, which ``openapi-typescript`` turns into ``web/src/api/types.ts`` — one

fill these in from numbers the core already produced (R̂, ESS, quantiles), so a
field carries a value, never a recipe for one.

Floats on the wire are always finite. R̂/ESS that the core could not estimate
arrive as ``None`` (not ``NaN``) because Starlette serializes with
